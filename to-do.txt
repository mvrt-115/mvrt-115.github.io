To-Do:
- rounded border radius
- join button purple
- icons to buttons

Done:
- slight border (maybe)
    - would need to kinda change padding to margin for it to work properly
    - mff... maybe
- media query
    - Example:
    @media (max-width: 768px) {
        .some-class {
            width: 100%;
        }

        .other-class {
            background-color: red;
        }
    } 

    - Actually this media query thing could be implemented for the team pictures in about as well
    - After this though
