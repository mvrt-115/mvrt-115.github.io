                        <p>
                          MVRT invited over 25 international students during the summer of 2016 to tour our facilities and learn 
                          about the FIRST Robotics Competition. Then in early 2017, we invited a new group of 30 international students 
                          to tour Monta Vista once again. MVRT also held a demo for the Taiwan Exchange Students. We are now supporting 
                          them as they start their own FRC team. The team is currently meeting on a daily basis based on the coach’s 
                          responses and has had a successful kickoff. They are meeting for Build Season and we are in constant contact
                          with them for them to be ready for this season. MVRT has also invited 25 new international students during 
                          the season this year to tour our facilities. We hope to continue a strong relationship and have them visit 
                          our facility every year and host a demo.

                          <h2>Mali</h2>
                          <p>
                            Through our partnership with iNerde, an organization that aims to spread STEM education in Africa, 
                            MVRT helped iNerde to  reach  133% of their annual goal for students impacted.  While researching iNerde, 
                            MVRT learned that they were creating a FIRST Global Challenge robotics team in Bamako, Mali, and were 
                            looking for more mentors. MVRT stepped in and provided a comprehensive curriculum for trainings along 
                            with a 24/7 support-line for their team. MVRT taught Team Mali about the fundamentals of running a FRC
                            team but also basic engineering skills using  an adaptation of the 3-month training plan MVRT uses for 
                            our rookie trainings.  At the end of the FIRST Global competition, Team Mali ended up winning the silver
                            medal Engineering Design.

                          <p>
                            Sisters in STEM (SiSTEM) is a program founded by our female veterans in 2016 to combat the lack of girls 
                            in STEM and encourage more females to join the team. Many girls felt discouraged to be a part of the team,
                            especially in the engineering divisions, and MVRT often experienced low retention rates of female members.
                            MVRT recognized the gender gap and difference in opportunities that currently exists in engineering fields
                            and provided a solution to the problem: the SiSTEM initiative. With this program, we have had an 80% 
                            increase in female attendance and member retention and an increase in overall team morale. We include
                            male veterans to take part in mentoring the little siblings, along with female rookies, to encourage
                            both genders to learn how to work together and bridge any disconnect present in the past. With more
                            people involved in our design and execution, our team has improved as a whole, as has our community. 
                            <br><br>

                            Additionally, to supplement the SiSTEM program, MVRT annually hosts symposiums in which we invite speakers 
                            to share how they overcame obstacles within their STEM journeys. The focus of these symposiums range from 
                            racial diversity issues to discrimination against females and members of the LGBTQIA+ community. Through 
                            these symposiums, MVRT hopes to educate those in our community and our own members, the future of the STEM 
                            world, so that we can make change and increase inclusivity holistically.

                          <p>
                            STEM4Kids was founded with a mission of expanding the world of STEM to those in our community 
                            to those who are underprivileged. Through weekly lessons over the course of a year, we taught the 
                            students concepts that paralleled their school curriculum in hopes of helping them improve their 
                            academic performance. The program’s curriculum covered foundational knowledge in biology, physics 
                            and chemistry, taught through both a lecture followed by lab activities. MVRT currently measures 
                            knowledge retention through surveys and short game quizzes, however, in the future as we filter 
                            through more groups of students, we hope to collect data centering around grade improvement because 
                            of the program’s initial goal.  Through this program, we hope to expand our mission to help provide 
                            equal opportunities to everyone in our community.

                            One of our most unique and innovative outreach programs is Hongyun Art—a series of classes based on teaching
                            kids STEM through art. MVRT worked with Hongyun Art, an art studio, by hosting camps for students and weekly
                            lessons. Using Java, Scratch, Python and Arudionos, students participate in several interactive art projects,
                            such as building an interactive mirror. Overall, the partnership is fulfilling to both sides, as MVRT students
                            are able to gain insight in art and creativity while Hongyun Art students can learn STEM skills.

                          <p>
                            MVRT formed a partnership with the Ohana Club, a club at Monta Vista dedicated to providing 
                            special education students with as many skills as possible, to teach students STEM concepts 
                            in an interactive, hands-on way. Throughout the years, our curriculum has evolved and improved 
                            based on feedback from both the Ohana students and the Ohana officer team. The program was founded 
                            in 2012 and has grown to have over 60 special education students participating in the program. 
                            Similarly, MVRT reached out to elementary schools in our school district, asking to provide weekly 
                            STEM classes throughout the year to their special needs students, paralleling their classroom 
                            curriculum. Throughout these lessons, the students were to form relations with our members, c
                            creating a bridge out of isolation for them during the pandemic, and helping them develop their 
                            interpersonal skills exiting the pandemic.  Additionally, by playing short games to quiz the 
                            students on their knowledge, MVRT has measured and guaranteed a foundational knowledge of physics, 
                            chemistry, and biology for the students.

                            MVRT stepped in when the Cupertino Union School District canceled the GATE program in 2005. 
                            To fill in the gap left by GATE, we offered the community free STEM education by holding weekly 
                            classes at local middle and elementary schools, developing a curriculum to teach basic engineering 
                            skills. The program has since taught over 300 students, many of which have joined FIRST programs. 
                            Through this program, students honed their communication and management skills and furthered their 
                            own understanding by teaching others.

                          <p>
                            CADology was founded at the aim of instilling a passion for robotics in elementary through middle 
                            school aged students using personalized and interactive classes. The students develop a foundational 
                            knowledge in computer aided design (CAD), an essential skill to build a robot, in an engaging and 
                            non-intimidating way with the help of our members. Students are broken up into groups by skill and 
                            experience with MVRT members, and learn how to CAD at a pace most comfortable for them. As an end 
                            project, students are able to see the outcome of their work by 3D printing their own model!

                          <p>
                            MVRT students have been given the opportunity to apply their knowledge from FIRST to the real world 
                            by working as professional engineers alongside Google and Intel employees. Our members worked with 
                            Google to build a robot arm to play tic tac toe, and through extensive testing, we helped Google 
                            restructure their APIs. Likewise, we beta-tested Intel’s real-sense camera in 2018, which was aimed 
                            to help FRC teams in the future. While our strong relations with our sponsors have helped provide 
                            more opportunities for our own members, we additionally strive to help our sponsors with their own 
                            projects, just as they have for us.
